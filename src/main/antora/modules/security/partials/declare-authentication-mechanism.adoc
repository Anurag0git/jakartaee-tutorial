To declare the usage of a specific authentication mechanism, Jakarta EE provides `[XYZ]MechanismDefinition` annotations. Such an annotation is picked up by the security system, and in response to it a CDI bean that implements the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` is enabled for it.

The annotation can be put on any bean, but in a REST application it fits particularly well on the `Application` subclass because it also declares the path for REST resources.
