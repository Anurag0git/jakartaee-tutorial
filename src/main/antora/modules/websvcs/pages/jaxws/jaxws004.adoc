== Web Services Interoperability and Jakarta XML Web Services

Jakarta XML Web Services supports the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) Basic Profile Version 1.1.
The WS-I Basic Profile is a document that clarifies the SOAP 1.1 and WSDL 1.1 specifications to promote SOAP interoperability.
For links related to WS-I, see xref:jaxws/jaxws.adoc#_further_information_about_jakarta_xml_web_services[Further Information about Jakarta XML Web Services].

To support WS-I Basic Profile Version 1.1, the JAX-WS runtime supports doc/literal and rpc/literal encodings for services, static ports, dynamic proxies, and the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).
